MultiJuicer deployed! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

MultiJuicer doesn't come with a default way to expose it to the world.
You can find guides for specific cloud providers here: https://github.com/iteratec/multi-juicer/tree/master/guides

To test it locally run:
$ kubectl port-forward service/juice-balancer 3000:3000
You'll then be able to access the JuiceBalancer in your browser under http://localhost:3000

To administrate the cluster you can log into the JuiceBalancer with the admin account:
Username: admin
Password: ${kubectl get secrets juice-balancer-secret -o=jsonpath='{.data.adminPassword}' | base64 --decode}
